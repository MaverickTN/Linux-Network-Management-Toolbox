# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Considerations

### Network Tools Security
This toolbox provides network management capabilities that require careful security considerations:

- **Privileged Operations**: Many network operations require elevated privileges
- **Command Execution**: Tools may execute system commands that could be exploited
- **Network Access**: Direct network interface manipulation requires careful input validation
- **Web Interface**: HTTP endpoints need protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report
1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email**: Send details to `maverick38344@gmail.com` or create a private security advisory on GitHub
3. **Encrypt**: Use our PGP key for sensitive communications (key ID: [YOUR_PGP_KEY_ID])

### What to Include
Please provide as much detail as possible:
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, and tool configuration
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the vulnerability (if applicable)

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Varies by severity (Critical: 7 days, High: 14 days, Medium: 30 days)
- **Disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security
- Always install from official sources (GitHub releases, PyPI)
- Verify checksums and signatures when available
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
- Keep the toolbox updated to the latest version

### Runtime Security
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run with minimal required permissions
- **Input Validation**: Be cautious with user-provided network addresses and parameters
- **Network Isolation**: Use in isolated network environments when possible
- **Logging**: Enable audit logging for security monitoring

### Configuration Security
- **Secure Defaults**: Default configurations prioritize security over convenience
- **Authentication**: Enable authentication for web interface access
- **HTTPS**: Use TLS encryption for web interface communications
- **Access Control**: Implement proper user access controls

## Common Security Risks

### Command Injection
**Risk**: Improper handling of user input in system commands
**Mitigation**: 
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Use parameterized commands instead of string concatenation
- Implement input whitelisting for network addresses and parameters

### Privilege Escalation
**Risk**: Unauthorized elevation of user privileges
**Mitigation**:
- Minimal privilege requirements clearly documented
- Separate privileged and non-privileged operations
- Use sudo/capability-based access where possible

### Information Disclosure
**Risk**: Exposure of sensitive network information
**Mitigation**:
- Sensitive data is not logged or displayed unnecessarily
- Network credentials are securely stored/handled
- Error messages don't reveal internal system details

### Web Interface Vulnerabilities
**Risk**: XSS, CSRF, and other web-based attacks
**Mitigation**:
- Input validation and output encoding
- CSRF protection tokens
- Secure session management
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Review
- All code changes require security review
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis for security issues

### Dependencies
- Regular updates of all dependencies
- Vulnerability scanning of third-party packages
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Pinned dependency versions in production

### Testing
- Security unit tests for input validation
- Integration tests for authentication/authorization
- Penetration testing for web interface
- Network security testing in isolated environments

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Communication**: Notify affected users via security advisory
4. **Remediation**: Deploy fixes and security updates
5. **Post-Incident**: Conduct review and improve security measures

### Security Updates
- **Critical**: Immediate release with security advisory
- **High**: Within 72 hours with detailed changelog
- **Medium/Low**: Included in next regular release

## Compliance and Standards

This project aims to comply with:
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
- **CWE**: Common Weakness Enumeration guidelines
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Security best practices
- **Linux Security Standards**: Platform-specific security requirements

## Security Contact
